# LED Light Bar Clip

This simple LED clip allows you to mount LED Strip (60 LED/meter spacing) to your 2020 Extrusion. It has baffles to block the light from shining in your face. Print one piece per LED, slide the strip through the parts, and then snap into the extrusion. At corners, you can cut the LED strip where marked for cutting and solder wires to jump to the next section, or you can have a continuous strip all the way around--the strip may just bunch up a bit in the corners. I typically mount these on the front and sides so they do not shine in my face.

Changelog:

- Version 3 adjusts the design to have larger hooks to grab the channel in the Misumi 2020 extrusion, and to allow more flex during insertion to accomodate the larger hooks.

- Version 2 shortens the total height of the clip to 16.5mm vs. the 17mm of the original version. This means the LEDs will be aligned with the openings in the baffles better.
